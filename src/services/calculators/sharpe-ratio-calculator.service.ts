/*
Sharpe Ratio â€” measures rate of return on the asset above risk-free investment,
such as treasury bonds or cash
In other words, measures whether the risk is justified against investing into risk-free assets
A Sharpe Ratio above 1.0 is considered good,
as it indicates potential excess return relative to the volatility of the asset

Sharpe Ratio = (Ticker Rate of Return - Risk Free Rate of Return) / Ticker Standard Deviation

Our Risk Free Rate of Return is US 1 Year Treasury Bond Yield
