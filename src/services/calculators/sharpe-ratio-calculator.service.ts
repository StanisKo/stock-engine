/*
Sharpe Ratio â€” measures rate of return on the asset above risk-free investment,
such as treasury bonds or cash

In other words, measures whether the risk is justified against investing into risk-free assets

Sharpe Ratio = (Ticker RoR - Risk-Free RoR) / Ticker SD

RoR = Rate of Return

SD = Standard Deviation

NOTE: Our Risk-Free Rate of Return is US 1 Year Treasury Bond Yield

GOAL:
