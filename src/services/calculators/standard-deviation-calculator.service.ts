/*
Standard Deviation is the square root of Variance

Therefore, in order to get to SD we need to calculate V

Variance, in it's turn, is the sum of squares of diffs
between Rate of Return and Avarage Rate of Return divided by count of returns minus one

Therefore, in order to get to V we need to calculate RoR and ARoR

In such, RoR and ARoR are the fundament of calculating SD

To get to RoR and ARoR we got to make use of available EOD (end of day) prices

When thinking of ARoR it is crucial to also factor in stocks splits,
since calculating over the raw dataset would skew the result

E.g., if one would own 1 share of $100 that would then grow to $120 and then the stock split of,
let's say, 1:6 take place, one would end up with 6 shares of $20 each

This drastically impacts stock price, since the curve would be $100 --> $120 --> $20,
skewing the calculation of average returns into negative territory, and, therefore, skewing the SD

Nevertheless and luckily for us, we have information on date and time of stocks splits per ticker

Therefore, what we need to do:

Chunk the dataset into subsets divided by stock splits dates

Calculate ARoR over each subset

Sum averages per subset and calculate average (of averages)

This would yield proper understanding of ticker's RoR

****

The described can be expressed as following:

SD = SQRT(V)

V = SUM(RoR - ARoR)Â² / N(RoR) - 1

RoR = (P2 - P1) / P1 * 100 where P2 is Nth price and P1 is previous

In such, we're calculating RoR over each closing price of current day against previous day*

ARoR = SUM(RoR) / N(RoR) where N is count of datapoints we have
