# Stock Profiles

<br />

Engine revolves around so-called Stock Profiles: a set of measurements and ratios
sculpted for every ticker based on fundamentals, prices, and issuer's financial papers -- balance sheet and income statement

<br />

Engine makes use of several third-party APIs to fetch stocks' financial data, creates profiles and sorts stocks within the same industry, delivering (potentially) most profitable stocks for each industry

<br />

Then, most most profitable stocks per industry are sorted against each other to arrive to most profitable
stocks on the market
