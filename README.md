# Industry Profiles

<br />

Engine revolves around so-called Industry Profiles: a set of measurements and ratios
sculpted from the most profitable stocks in each industry

<br />

Engine makes use of several third-party APIs to fetch stocks' financial data (fundamentals)
and sort them against the profile, delivering a collection of (potentially) most
profitable stocks in the industry
